### Overview

**DifCoRank** is an integrated framework to identify differentially coexpressed gene modules and prioritize key regulators (hub genes) associated with tissue responses to implanted devices. The pipeline combines:

- **RNA-Seq Data Preprocessing & Gene Filtering**  
- **Correlation-Based Module Identification**  
- **Hybrid Clustering** using UMAP + DBSCAN  
- **Multi-criteria Hub Gene Ranking** with centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)

### Features

- **Gene-Centric Approach**: Focuses on individual gene-gene correlations rather than only module-level analysis.  
- **UMAP + DBSCAN**: Enhanced clustering to handle non-linear high-dimensional data, revealing subtle co-expression structures.  
- **Network Centrality-Based Hub Detection**: Ranks genes by multiple centrality criteria, revealing key regulators of tissue responses.

### Overview

**DiffCoRank** is an integrated framework to identify differentially coexpressed gene modules and prioritize key regulators (hub genes) associated with tissue responses to implanted devices. The pipeline combines:

- **RNA-Seq Data Preprocessing & Gene Filtering**  
- **Correlation-Based Module Identification**  
- **Hybrid Clustering** using UMAP + DBSCAN  
- **Multi-criteria Hub Gene Ranking** with centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)

This repository accompanies our paper:

### Features

- **Gene-Centric Approach**: Focuses on individual gene-gene correlations rather than only module-level analysis.  
- **UMAP + DBSCAN**: Enhanced clustering to handle non-linear high-dimensional data, revealing subtle co-expression structures.  
- **Network Centrality-Based Hub Detection**: Ranks genes by multiple centrality criteria, revealing key regulators of tissue responses.

## üìö User Guide

Follow these steps to load your data, run the full DiffCoRank pipeline, and see your results.

### 1. Prepare Your Input Files

- **Rlog Normalized Counts (CSV/TXT)**  
  A matrix of log-transformed, normalized expression values.  
  - **Rows:** Gene IDs  
  - **Columns:** Sample names  
- **Raw Counts (CSV/TXT)**  
  Your original raw gene-count matrix.  
  - Same shape and sample order as the Rlog file.  
- **Sample Metadata (CSV)**  
  Metadata linking each sample to an experimental condition.  
  - Must contain at least two columns:  
    1. `sample` (matching the column names in your counts files)  
    2. `source` (e.g. "near" / "far")

---

### 2. Launch the App

```bash
# If you're using Docker:
docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name diffcorank_app anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
open http://localhost:8501

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

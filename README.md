### Overview

**DiffCoRank** is an integrated framework to identify differentially coexpressed gene modules and prioritize key regulators (hub genes) associated with tissue responses to implanted devices. The pipeline combines:

- **RNA-Seq Data Preprocessing & Gene Filtering**  
- **Correlation-Based Module Identification**  
- **Hybrid Clustering** using UMAP + DBSCAN  
- **Multi-criteria Hub Gene Ranking** with centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)

This repository accompanies our paper:

### Features

- **Gene-Centric Approach**: Focuses on individual gene-gene correlations rather than only module-level analysis.  
- **UMAP + DBSCAN**: Enhanced clustering to handle non-linear high-dimensional data, revealing subtle co-expression structures.  
- **Network Centrality-Based Hub Detection**: Ranks genes by multiple centrality criteria, revealing key regulators of tissue responses.

# üê≥ DiffCoRank Docker Deployment Guide

## Quick Start with Docker

Follow these steps to get DiffCoRank up and running using Docker.

1. **Pull the official image from Docker Hub**  
   ```bash
   docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 \
     --name diffcorank_app \
     anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   ```

3. **Open in your browser**
   Navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

4. **Stop & remove**
   ```bash
   docker stop diffcorank_app
   docker rm diffcorank_app
   ```

## üíª Platform-Specific Instructions

### üêß Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install Docker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# (Optional) Allow your user to run Docker without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out & back in, or run:
newgrp docker

# Pull & run DiffCoRank
docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 \
  --name diffcorank_app \
  anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
```

### üçé macOS
1. Download and install **Docker Desktop** from
   [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Open **Terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 \
     --name diffcorank_app \
     anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   ```
3. Browse to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

### ‚äû Windows
#### Docker Desktop (Recommended)
1. Install **Docker Desktop** from
   [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 `
     --name diffcorank_app `
     anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   ```
3. Visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

#### WSL2 Integration
1. Ensure **WSL2** is installed and Docker Desktop is configured to use the WSL2 engine
2. In your WSL2 distribution shell:
   ```bash
   docker pull anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 \
     --name diffcorank_app \
     anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8501` in your Windows browser

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Build & Development (Optional)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msureil/DiffCoRank.git
cd DiffCoRank/DiffCoRank_App

# Build & tag
docker build -t anirban1231/diffcorank:latest .

# Run
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 \
  --name diffcorank_app \
  anirban1231/diffcorank:latest
```

## üìñ Additional Resources

- **Requirements**: Python 3.8+, Streamlit, pandas, numpy, networkx, matplotlib
- **Configuration**: Customize theme or port in `.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Permission errors on Linux? Add user to `docker` group
  - Windows issues? Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS
  - Port conflict? Change `8501` to another port in both commands

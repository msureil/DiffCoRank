### Overview

**DifCoRank** is an integrated framework designed to identify differentially coexpressed gene modules and prioritize key regulators (hub genes) associated with tissue responses to implanted devices. The pipeline combines:

- **RNA-Seq Data Preprocessing & Gene Filtering**  
- **Correlation-Based Module Identification**  
- **Hybrid Clustering** using UMAP + DBSCAN  
- **Multi-criteria Hub Gene Ranking** with centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)

This repository accompanies our paper:  
> Chakraborty, A., Purcell, E.K., & Moore, M.G. *DifCoRank: A Comprehensive Framework for Discovering Hub Genes and Differential Gene Co-expression in Brain Implant-Associated Tissue Responses*. (Under Review in BMC Bioinformatics, 2025).

### Features

- **Gene-Centric Approach**: Focuses on individual gene-gene correlations rather than only module-level analysis.  
- **UMAP + DBSCAN**: Enhanced clustering to handle non-linear high-dimensional data, revealing subtle co-expression structures.  
- **Network Centrality-Based Hub Detection**: Ranks genes by multiple centrality criteria, revealing key regulators of tissue responses.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msureil/DifCoRank.git
   cd DifCoRank
   ```

2. **Create/Activate a Python Environment (Recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `networkx`, `scikit-learn`, and `umap-learn`.

### Usage

Below is a high-level workflow to run DifCoRank on your dataset. More detailed instructions can be found in `notebooks/Demo.ipynb`.

1. **Prepare Your RNA-Seq Data**  
   - Provide raw or normalized expression counts in a CSV or TSV file, with rows as genes and columns as samples.  

2. **Run the Pipeline**  

3. **Review Outputs**  
   - **Clustered Modules**: Gene assignments to each co-expression cluster.  
   - **Hub Gene Ranks**: CSV files listing genes by average centrality rank.  
   - **Figures**: Plots of UMAP embeddings, DBSCAN clusters, and adjacency histograms.
